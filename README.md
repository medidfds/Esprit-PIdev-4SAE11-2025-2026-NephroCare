# NephroCare - Smart Nephrology Management Platform

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the **PIDEV - 3rd Year Engineering Program** at **Esprit School of Engineering** (Academic Year **2025-2026**).

NephroCare is a full-stack healthcare platform designed to support nephrology workflows, including clinical follow-up, hospitalization monitoring, diagnostics, dialysis tracking, and pharmacy management.

## Features
- Role-based authentication and access control (Keycloak)
- Clinical module (consultations, triage, medical history)
- Hospitalization module (vital signs, admissions, patient monitoring)
- Diagnostic module (orders and result tracking)
- Dialysis module (sessions and treatment lifecycle)
- Pharmacy module (medications and prescription workflow)
- Notifications and alerts for critical conditions
- Back Office dashboard for operational supervision

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Angular
- TypeScript
- Bootstrap / CSS
- RxJS

### Backend
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud (API Gateway, Eureka Discovery)
- MySQL
- Keycloak (IAM / SSO)

## Architecture
The system follows a **microservices architecture**:
- `Api-Gateway`
- `discovery-service`
- `user-service`
- `clinical-service`
- `Hospitalization-service`
- `diagnostic-service`
- `dialysis-service`
- `pharmacy-service`

Each service is independently deployable and communicates via REST APIs.
